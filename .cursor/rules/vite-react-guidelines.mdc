# Cursor Rules — vite-react-guidelines.mdc

## Framework conventions
- Use Vite + React + TypeScript.
- Use functional components and React hooks.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies and heavy libraries.

## Routing
- Use `react-router-dom`.
- Pages must be placed in `src/pages`.
- Routes should be simple and explicit.

## State management
- Prefer local component state for UI.
- Use TanStack Query for async data and caching.
- Avoid global state unless necessary.

## Data fetching
- All API calls must be placed in `src/services`.
- Components must not fetch data directly via `fetch`.
- Handle loading and error states explicitly.

## Performance
- Keep components small and focused.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Memoize only when there is a clear performance benefit.

## Environment & config
- Use `import.meta.env` for environment variables.
- Do not hardcode environment-specific values.
